After procrastinating for way too long, I finally launched my YouTube channel!

%[https://twitter.com/Arindam_1729/status/1902379614846288370] 

I always had a keen interest in being a YouTuber or content creator (haha, really!)  
  
Two years ago, I challe

nged myself to start blogging, and with over 500k views, it became something I truly enjoyed.

Now, it's time for a new challenge - video content.

## A Big Hurdle

But as a camera-shy person, recording a video was a big challenge for me. A simple 4-5 minute video took multiple retakes (okay, a LOT of retakes).

I realized that knowing something and teaching it are completely different skills. Recording forced me to structure my thoughts, explain concepts more clearly, and refine my storytelling in ways I hadn't expected.

It's uncomfortable. It's frustrating. But it's also incredibly rewarding.

## The First Attempt ‚Äì What Went Wrong?

A year ago, I started recording videos, casually sharing my thoughts rather than diving into technical content.

I recorded a couple of videos and published them. But after sometime, I became busy with some other works and started neglecting the Video creation part.

Looking back, it wasn‚Äôt just a lack of time; it was hesitation, self-doubt, and the classic trap of "I'll start next week."

## Why Now?

This time, I‚Äôm going all in. No more excuses. I‚Äôve realized that consistency is key, and content creation is something I genuinely enjoy.

So, I‚Äôve set a proper schedule, building projects, recording videos, and talking about them. I‚Äôll be sharing the projects I‚Äôm building, mistakes I made, and things I learnt from them.

I‚Äôve already published a few Videos and am working on a series of videos where I‚Äôll build AI Agents.

## What My Channel is About

I love to build project with so I‚Äôve started posting videos around that!

If you‚Äôre into any of these topics, you‚Äôll find something valuable on my channel:

‚Üí **Generative AI**  
‚Üí **AI Agents**  
‚Üí **Open Source**  
‚Üí **My Journey & Learnings**

I‚Äôve recently started a playlist called ‚Äú[**Building AI Agents with Me**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZM1DAlf0LqixhAG9BDk4O_FjqnaogK8)‚Äù where I experiment with different frameworks and share the full process - mistakes, learnings, and everything in between

## A Huge Thank You!

This is just the beginning. I‚Äôm excited to push past my comfort zone, improve my storytelling, and build something truly valuable for the community.

The tech community has always been incredibly supportive, whether it‚Äôs written content or video, and I‚Äôm so grateful for that. I hope to keep providing valuable content that helps and inspires others.

If you enjoy hands-on coding, AI experiments, and learning together, I‚Äôd love for you to subscribe and be part of this journey.
