Suppose you’re building an application for a global audience.

In that case, you need to understand the nuances of your users, their location, timezone, currency, and even the risks associated with their IP address.

These details can help you make your application more accessible and user-friendly.

But tracking user locations in real-time?

That’s not an easy task. But, [**IPstack API**](http://ipstack.com?utm_source=FirstPromoter&utm_medium=Affiliate&fpr=arindam24) makes it easy to get detailed geolocation data from any IP address.

This API doesn’t just give you the basics like country or city, it also provides currency, timezone, and even security insights, such as whether the IP is from a proxy or risky source. It’s perfect for tailoring user experiences, improving security, or even just understanding your audience better.

If you want to use [IPStack](http://ipstack.com?utm_source=FirstPromoter&utm_medium=Affiliate&fpr=arindam24) on Postman, You can follow this shout Guide:

## [User Agent API](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/user_agent-api)\- Optimize experiences for every device

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737808400463/22073fda-0fc8-44b8-8fdb-133953afb76a.png align="center")

When you’re building for the web, you can’t generalize everything.

Your users are accessing your app from phones, tablets, desktops, and even bots. Different devices mean different screen sizes, capabilities, and browsing behaviors, so if you’re not optimizing for these variations, you’re probably losing users.

That’s where the **User Agent API** comes in. This API allows you to reliably detect what type of device your users are on, mobile, tablet, desktop, or bot, and provides key details about their browser, operating system, and even whether they have touch capabilities.

It’s a simple but essential tool for delivering a seamless experience, no matter what device your users prefer.

To use the User Agent API, simply parse the User Agent string from your users’ HTTP headers. Here’s an example request for detecting devices:

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url 'https://api.apilayer.com/user_agent/detect?ua=Mozilla/5.0%20(Windows%20NT%2010.0;%20Win64;%20x64)' \
--header 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

The API will break down the user agent string into actionable details like this:

```json
{
    "type": {
        "mobile": false,
        "tablet": false,
        "touch_capable": false,
        "pc": true,
        "bot": false
    },
    "browser": {
        "name": "Chrome",
        "version_major": 85,
        "version": "85.0.4183"
    },
    "os": {
        "name": "Windows",
        "version_major": 10,
        "version": "10"
    },
    "device": {
        "name": "Other",
        "brand": null,
        "model": null
    }
}
```

You can also generate random user-agent strings, useful for web scraping or testing.

### **Why Use It?**

1. **Device-Based Personalization:** Serve tailored experiences to your users based on their device type.
    
2. **Dynamic Content Delivery:** Detect browser types and versions to ensure compatibility or suggest browser upgrades for a better experience.
    
3. **Improve Marketing Strategies:** Use device data to segment your audience.
    
4. **Future-Proof Your Product:** Plan and configure your services based on the majority of devices accessing your app.
    

Whether you’re creating a responsive design, optimizing performance, or targeting specific user segments, the **User Agent API** gives you the insights you need to build better, smarter, and more user-friendly applications.

It’s simple to use and delivers valuable data that can make all the difference.

## [**Violence Detection API**](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/violence_detection-api) **\-** Keep Your Platform Safe and Responsible

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737808479405/eb4f492a-15f1-47e5-9459-66ee19534498.png align="center")

If you’re working on a platform where users upload images / Generate Images with AI, moderating that content is a big challenge.

Ensuring that violent or inappropriate content doesn’t slip through is critical, but manually reviewing images isn’t scalable.

I recently built an AI Powered Logo Generator,([here’s the tweet about it](https://x.com/Arindam_1729/status/1882429820526846103)), and while building that I ran into an unexpected issue: AI sometimes generates results that are… less than ideal. Removing inappropriate or violent imagery turned out to be trickier than I expected.

After Finding solutions here and there, I came across this “Violence Detection API” and that really helped me.

This API’s ability to distinguish between harmless imagery (like someone holding a kitchen knife while laughing) and genuinely concerning content (like threatening gestures with weapons) makes it an invaluable tool for developers working on user-generated content platforms.

Here’s how you can use the API to classify images and ensure your platform stays safe:

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url 'https://api.apilayer.com/violence_detection' \
--header 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data-binary '@image.jpg'
```

```bash
{
  "description": "Possible violence",
  "value": 3
}
```

> Note:
> 
> * **Value 1:** Very unlikely contains violence (safe).
>     
> * **Value 2:** Unlikely contains violence (still safe).
>     
> * **Value 3:** Possible violence (requires review).
>     
> * **Value 4 or 5:** Likely or highly likely contains violence (should be flagged).
>     

Let’s see how it works with some examples,

A kitchen knife is sharp and can be dangerous, but unless you’re the onion on the table, it’s completely harmless in this context. The API is smart enough to recognize this and classify it as safe.

![Knife on Table](https://assets.apilayer.com/apis/codes/violence_detection/knife_on_table.jpg align="left")

The response from the API is as expected.

```python
{
  "description": "Very unlikely contains violence",
  "value": 1
}
```

Now, there is a lady holding a cleaver for a show or a similar occasion. She is laughing so we get the idea that she is joking. It shouldn't be taken that seriously.

![Joking with a knife](https://assets.apilayer.com/apis/codes/violence_detection/knife_joke.jpg align="left")

The response from the API is as expected. Still no violence, but value = 2 means, there may be some chance of a crime.

```python
{
  "description": "Unlikely contains violence",
  "value": 2
}
```

Lastly, things are getting serious. The model wearing a pirate suit, is pointing the knife to the shutter with a shadowy face. So, this can be a sign of violence.

![Pirate holding a knife](https://assets.promptapi.com/apis/codes/violence_detection/pirate.jpg align="left")

The response from the API notes that this may be a possible violent picture.

```python
{
  "description": "Possible violence",
  "value": 3
}
```

If you’re building a messaging app, an image-sharing platform, or even an AI-powered content generator, the **Violence Detection API** helps you keep your platform safe and compliant.

If you’re building a B2C Application, reviews, social media, and customer feedback, understanding user sentiment becomes really important.

Are users happy, frustrated, or somewhere in between? This is where **Sentiment Analysis API** becomes your secret weapon.

Sentiment analysis, a concept in Natural Language Processing, helps classify text into categories like positive, negative, or neutral. And while even humans can struggle with sarcasm or ambiguous statements, this API comes pre-trained with thousands of real-life examples to analyze sentiment *on par with humans*.

![He Does Even Lift GIFs - Find & Share on GIPHY](https://media3.giphy.com/media/ysV4jBFUA5ksg/giphy.gif?cid=6c09b9528fssptaey6gd7jq6zzpecb4qjjod584fgr1w0fqy&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g align="center")

  "body": "This restaurant has a lovely atmosphere and the staff is great!"
}'
```

The API analyzes the text and returns a response like this:

```json
{
  "content_type": "text",
  "language": "en",
  "sentiment": "positive"
}
```

Here are some example use cases, where you can use this API:
